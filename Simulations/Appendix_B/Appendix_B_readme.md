## Reproducibility Instructions

This repository contains code used to reproduce **Figure 5** in **Appendix B** of the manuscript. 

- **`no_robust_case_v1.R`**  
For each sample size $n$, output 2000 p-values for $M_{n1}$, which is used to calculate the empirical rejection rate.

- **`no_robust_case_v2.R`**  
For each sample size $n$, output 2000 p-values for $M_{n2}$, which is used to calculate the empirical rejection rate.

- **`no_robust_case_v3.R`**  
For each sample size $n$, output 2000 p-values for $M_{n3}$, which is used to calculate the empirical rejection rate.

- **`no_robust_case_v4.R`**  
For each sample size $n$, output 2000 p-values for $M_{n4}$, which is used to calculate the empirical rejection rate.

- **`no_robust_case_v5.R`**  
  - Code before line 140: For each sample size $n$, output 2000 p-values for $M_{n5}$, which is used to calculate the empirical rejection rate.
  - Code after line 140: plot **Figure 5** in **Appendix B** of the manuscript.
